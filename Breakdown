This is UCT's way of teaching compsci:

We are taught a new section of programming each week (1st semester is purely python)
In this week you will:
-   Recieve an assignment of about 3-4 questions with problems relating to the content
-   Complete a practical Test based on the content of the week

The code is all marked by automarker , which is why code is a tad pedantic
or unorganized
